# Kotlin Programming By Example
This is the code repository for [Kotlin Programming By Example](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/kotlin-programming-example?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788474542), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
Kotlin greatly reduces source code verbosity; with the recently announced first class support from the Android team, a great opportunity has been created. The book will help you learn how to create apps with Kotlin from scratch and get them up-and-running.

Starting with an introduction to Kotlin, this book will take you through building blocks such as functions, classes, and more. Various features of Kotlin will be explored by building three application of varying complexity. For a quick start to Android development we look at building a classic game Tetris and elaborate on Object Oriented Programming in Kotlin. Our next application is a messenger app, a level up in complexity; we will design and implement the backend as well. Before we move to the third app, we take a look at methods of data persistence, helping us learn storage and retrieval of useful application. Our final app is a Place reviewer; a web application will be making use of the Google Maps API and Placepicker.

By end of the book you will have gained experience of how to create and deploy Android applications using Kotlin.
## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.

Chapter 8 doesnot have code files. Chapter 2 and 3, Chapter 5 and 6, Chapter 9 and 10 codes are combined in a single folder.

The code will look like the following:
```
release {
  storeFile file("../my-release-key.jks")
  storePassword "password"
  keyAlias "my-alias"
  keyPassword "password"
}
```

If you are a beginner, begin this book with an open mind and a drive to learn. You may find the task of learning a new language daunting at first, but with perseverance, you will be a professional in no time. Read through each chapter in the order they are presented in. This will ensure you grasp all of the content within the book. Take special care to read through each code snippet so as to fully understand what is being done. Implement and run each program in this book yourself.
